### Introduction
I'm a 26 years old student based in Norway, Trondheim. Born and raised here, but my parents are from Hong Kong, and Vietnam. Who would've thought that results into a Norwegian, English and Cantonese speaking kid. I used to (since I don't have much time now) do language studying in my freetime, so I do possess some basic conversational skills in Japanese, Chinese mandarin and French. (Confidence from left to right)

I have a Bachelor degree in Mathematics, and currently wrapping a Bachelor's degree in Informatics where I expect to finish June 2021. I am therefore interested in a job or a graduate program. With experience in both frontend, backend, and skills such as Java, JavaScript, Golang, Python, agile, I'm still open to try everything in the programming world. 

### Why the switch?
My road to programming and Informatics didn't start until 2019. In fact I started studying Mathematics without any goals, almost dropping out even, but along the road I picked up some introduction programming course, and this made me meet an entirely different world. I managed to finish my first degree, and now I'm happily studying something I really enjoy, and I really look forward to what I can do after graduating. 

### My vision
__*"Less is more, and less is equivalent to dark mode" - proudly by me*__\
I'm not too hyped on design, you may call me old fashioned, but I have a strong preference for dark mode and big chunks divided of functionality. This may be my weakness too, since most of the time I need to ask for inputs from others due to my style in design. 

### Goals for 2021
- [ ] Graduate in June 2021
- [ ] Find a main developer specialization to commit on
- [x] Create an own website
- [ ] Get myself a new picture
- [ ] Start on a sideproject 
- [ ] Write a post Postman usage during my web development course (LOVE POSTMAN)
- [ ] Do something for my family
- [ ] Patiently wait for the pandemic to end
